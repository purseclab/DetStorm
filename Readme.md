1. To generate attack dictionaries, use CustomizedPhantomSponges/BatchReferenceImgs_attack
2. To attack videos, use run_attack_video given a patch dictionary

Paths are configurable to point to the correct directories.  Code will automatically produce attacked video samples (digital attack switch) or dynamic projectable perturbation patterns (real world switch).
